                <h1>Origin of Corgis</h1>
                <p>Pembrokes are very smart, sensitive dogs who respond well to training and mental challenges. As herding dogs bred to move cattle from one place to another, they are fearless, independent workers. A Pembroke without a job will often assign himself work, like herding children or his fellow dogs. They make excellent watchdogs, with acute senses and a “big dog” bark. Families who can meet the Pembroke’s need for activity and togetherness will never have a more loyal, loving pet.</p>
